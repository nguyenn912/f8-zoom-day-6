                                Keep it to 1 page if you have less than 8 years
                                of professional work experience. If you have
                                more, you might consider using 2 pages.

                                scan resumes for numbers, so quantify as much as
                                you can.

                                Avoid writing bullet points that are longer than
                                2 lines. No recruiters will lead bullet points
                                that are as long as paragraphs.

                                Carefully review your resume several times to
                                eliminate any typos. Additionally, consider
                                having someone else proofread it to prevent
                                sending an imperfect resume.

                                Be consistent with grammar. Generally, resumes
                                should be written in the past tense. The
                                exception is if you're describing your current
